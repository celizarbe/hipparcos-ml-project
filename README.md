# Classification of stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue
Course: Data Science (29780) - Coderhouse

## Preface
This project is for **educational purposes _only_**.

This project's objectives are:
* To apply and asses the performance of different classification algorithms using data from stars in the Hipparcos Catalogue.
* To find the best-performing algorithm and optimize its hyperparameters.

Importantly, for simplicity's sake, this project **will not** explore astronomical, astrometrical, photometrical or otherwise related concepts **in any depth**, except _succintly_ when necessary to justify feature selection decisions.

## Introduction
This project utilizes data from the Hipparcos Catalogue, published by the the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1997.

The Hipparcos astrometry mission had the primary objective of determining accurate astrometric data - positions, annual proper motions and absolute trigonometric parallaxes - with the Hipparcos satellite, which was launched on 8 August 1989 and operated between November 1989 and March 1993. The mission produced two major astrometric catalogues, the Hipparcos Catalogue (of 118 218 stars) and the Tycho Catalogue (of more than one million stars) as a result.

Further information on both Catalogues can be found in ESA's [dedicated page](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/hipparcos/catalogues).

The data has been obtained from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konivat/hipparcos-star-catalog) Kaggle dataset.

The data fields are described in [The Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues Vol  1](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/532822/552851/vol1_all.pdf/99adf6e3-6893-4824-8fc2-8d3c9cbba2b5) § 2.1 (p. 105 - 137).
